## Brief

The goal of this project is to create a web application that displays
a table of Keywords and highlights the trending ones.

## Requirements

- Must use TypeScript.
- Must use [these designs](https://www.figma.com/file/E1rI2ufda9jmxcoLSeba1L/Test-project?node-id=0%3A1) to build your layout. Please notice the Desktop and the Mobile visuals.
- Must use the generated REST API to fetch your data. You can o it by running this script `yarn run server` if you haven't already :)
- Must paginate the list of Keywords with the "Load more Keywords" button.
- Users must be able to sort ascending and descending the columns.
- On Mobile, only 2 columns are visible, make it possible so that the user can view a different from the dropdown.
- The dropdown selection and the column sorting should persist when the user closes and reopens the web app.

## Bonus

- Add automated or unit tests where it makes sense.
- Add some accessibility features.
