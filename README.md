## Instructions

## Brief

The goal of this project is to create a web application that displays a table of Keywords, paginate through them and highlights the trending ones.

## Requirements

- Use the provided REST API to fetch your data â€” check the [instructions](#instructions) above.
- Use [these designs](https://www.figma.com/file/E1rI2ufda9jmxcoLSeba1L/Test-project?node-id=0%3A1) to build your layout. On mobile, only 2 columns are visible, you need to make it possible for users to view a different column using the dropdown.
- Users need to be able to paginate through the list of Keywords. You can use whatever pagination strategy you like, just make it so that it persists when closing and/or reopening the app.
- Users need to be able to sort ascending and descending the columns. This should also be persisted.

Ask questions and check in as often as you like during the project.
